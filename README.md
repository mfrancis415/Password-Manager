# Password Manager 
## Description
This is a successful beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates how to securely encrypt and decrypt passwords using the cryptography library. Developed and tested on [Replit](https://replit.com), this project is part of my personal journey into cybersecurity and focuses on real-world skills relevant to a Security Specialist role.

## Languages and Utilites Used
- Language: Python
- Cryptography - for secure password encryption and decryption (Fernet)
- Logging - for writing log messages and tracking process flow
- Tool:
  - Replit - for development and testing (cloud-based IDE used for writing, testing, and running the project)

## What I Learned
- How to use Fernet for encryption and decryption in Python.
- The importance of storing encryption keys securely and implementing error handling in cryptographic systems. 
- The role of logging, especially for tracking execution and debugging in secure systems.
- How encryption fits into the broader context of cybersecurity and password management.

## Project Setup
This project was bulit and ran entirely on Replit. You code vide the code [Here](https://github.com/mfrancis415/Password-Manager/blob/main/password_manager.py) andfollow along at varies stages with the screenshot below.

# What's Next
- Add salting and hashing to further enhance password security.
- Refactor for user-defined input instead of a hardcoded password.
- Introduce input filtering and validation to secure user interactions.
- Develop intermediate and advanced versions to showcase progress:
  - Implement a CLI menu and erro log viewer
  - Integrate a GUI or a web interface.
